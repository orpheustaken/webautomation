# Software Web Testing

#### 2023 Information Update

**You should use Cypress instead...**

---

This Maven Project was made to practice automated web testing using Java, Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber/Gherkin.

## Context
I was applying for a Test Engineer role and the company required me to submit a project similar to this one, along with mobile testing as well.

The procedure for running mobile testing is essentially the same but with additional tools, specifically [Appium](https://github.com/appium/appium) and an Android Emulator in that case.
